* Job application tracking by status (Applied, Interview, Offer, Rejected)
* Resume upload, storage, and management with secure access
* Analytics dashboard for insights into job application trends
* AI job description summarization

## Technologies Used

### Frontend

* Next.js (Pages Router)
* TailwindCSS
* NextAuth.js (Google OAuth)
* TypeScript
* Axios

### Backend

* Flask (Python)
* SQLAlchemy ORM
* PostgreSQL (via SQLAlchemy)
* Boto3 for AWS S3 integration
* Hugging Face Transformers API for job description summarization

### Infrastructure and Deployment

* **AWS EC2**: The frontend and backend services are deployed in separate Docker containers on EC2 instances.
* **AWS S3**: Used for storing user-uploaded resumes securely and efficiently.
* **AWS RDS (PostgreSQL)**: Hosts the application's relational database.
* **Hugging Face Inference API**: Provides natural language summarization of job descriptions using the `distilbart-cnn-12-6` model. The integration is secured via an API token, as shown below:

  ```python
  API_URL = "https://api-inference.huggingface.co/models/sshleifer/distilbart-cnn-12-6"
  HF_TOKEN = os.environ.get("API_TOKEN")
  HEADERS = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {HF_TOKEN}"}
  ```

GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=nextauth_secret
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
DATABASE_URL=database_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000
```

#### Backend (.env)

```
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
FLASK_SECRET_KEY=your_flask_secret_key
DATABASE_URL=database_url
API_TOKEN=api_token
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=aws_access_key_id
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=aws_secret_access_key
AWS_S3_BUCKET=aws_s3_bucket

```

### 3. Run with Docker (optional)
